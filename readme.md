<H1>HTML5 Example for Force.com</H1>
<P>
This is just a set of sample code for integrating Offline Databases and Web Application Cache with your Force.com instance.  Some of the code requires a custom object "Quark" to be in existence, and the custom fields "Spin" and "Mass" of number/decimal type.  The example code assumes those fields to be of 1.0 or less value.  The "Neutron Bomb" class has methods for creating 900 quarks with random test data.
