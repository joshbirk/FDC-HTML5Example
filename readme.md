<H1>HTML5 Example for Force.com</H1>
<P>
This is just a set of sample code for integrating Offline Databases and Web Application Cache with your Force.com instance.  Some of the code requires a custom object "Quark" to be in existence, and the custom fields "Spin" and "Mass" of number/decimal type.  The example code assumes those fields to be of 1.0 or less value.  The "Neutron Bomb" class has methods for creating 900 quarks with random test data.

I'll provide more readme.md's on a file by file basis at a later date.  For now, feel free to twitter me questions @joshbirk.
